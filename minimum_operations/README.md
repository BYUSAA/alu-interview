Minimum Operations
Description
This project provides a Python solution to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to achieve exactly n 'H' characters in a text editor file. The allowed operations are:

Copy All: Copies all the 'H' characters in the file.
Paste: Pastes the copied characters.
The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reach exactly n characters using the least number of Copy and Paste operations.

Prototype
python
Copy code
def minOperations(n)
Parameters
n (integer): The target number of 'H' characters.
Returns
Returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations required.
If it is impossible to achieve exactly n 'H' characters, return 0.
Example
bash
Copy code
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
For example, when n = 9:

javascript
Copy code
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
Number of operations: 6

Files
0-minoperations.py: Contains the minOperations function that computes the minimum operations.
0-main.py: Main file for testing the function.
PEP8 Compliance
This solution adheres to PEP8 guidelines:

No line exceeds 79 characters.
Proper blank lines between functions and classes (two blank lines).
No trailing whitespaces on blank lines.
Code is clean, readable, and properly documented.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/BYUSAA/alu-interview.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd alu-interview/minimum_operations
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
./0-main.py
Requirements
Python 3.x
Edge Cases
The solution handles the following edge cases:

n = 0: Returns 0 because it's impossible to have zero 'H' characters.
n = 1: Returns 0 as only one 'H' exists without any operations.
n < 0: Returns 0 for negative values since it's impossible to have a negative number of 'H' characters.
Large values: Efficiently calculates the minimum operations for large values like n = 2147483640.
