Minimum Operations
Description
This project focuses on solving the problem of calculating the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in a text editor file. The allowed operations are:

Copy All: Copies all the 'H' characters in the file.
Paste: Paste the copied characters.
Given a number n, the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly n characters.

Prototype
Python
Copy code
def minOperations(n)
Parameters
n (integer): The target number of 'H' characters.
Returns
Returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations required.
If achieving exactly n 'H' characters is impossible, return 0.
Example
bash
Copy code
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
For example, when n = 9:

javascript
Copy code
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
Number of operations: 6

Files
0-minoperations.py: Contains the minOperations function that computes the minimum operations.
0-main.py: Main file for testing the function.
